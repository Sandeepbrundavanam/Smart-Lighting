I developed an IoT-based smart lighting system using Python, Arduino, and sensor modules such as LDR and PIR to automate light control based on occupancy and ambient light conditions. The system dynamically adjusted LED brightness, resulting in up to 30% energy savings. I utilized the MQTT protocol for device-to-cloud communication, allowing remote control and monitoring of the system. The project involved writing Python scripts to process real-time sensor data and automate lighting decisions. I also designed the hardware prototype, integrating sensors and actuators with microcontroller logic to create an efficient, responsive system. Extensive testing ensured reliability under varying environmental conditions.
